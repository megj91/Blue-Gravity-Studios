When developing this system, my primary focus was on ensuring code scalability. To accomplish this, I made the decision to use scriptable objects to manage the various configurations related to clothing, which I referred to as "wearables." This approach allowed me to easily handle different clothing options within the game. Additionally, I implemented an interface for items, which provided a consistent way to interact with various game elements.

For setting up the scene, I utilized the default Unity tilemap template. This template streamlined the process of constructing the game environment and allowed for a more efficient development experience. In terms of character animation, I employed a sprite sheet to create a visually appealing character. To facilitate the smooth integration of animations, I used three animators. These animators were responsible for loading the current wearable and setting it up within the sprite renderer. This process included updating the character's shirt and pants in real-time as they changed within the game.

To further enhance the game experience, I developed an inventory system that allowed players to store and manage their collected wearables. This system provided an organized way for users to access and utilize their various clothing options throughout gameplay. Alongside the inventory system, I also created a storage system to save the current user data. By storing this data as JSON in the persistent data path.
